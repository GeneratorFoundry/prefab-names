# Prefabricated Names

General purpose storage for prefabricated names.

## Structure

* `documentation` contains documentation (on how things were generated, mirroring the `storage` structure);
* `notes` contains general notes that do not belong in the wiki (are fixed to generation models);
* `storage` contains the names.
 
In `storage` the extension determines the storage type.  If in doubt, store it in JSON.

(More forthcoming.)
